# GitHub Config Sync — Project Plan & Tracker

Use this as the single source of truth for **where we are**, **what is next**, and **what is done**.

---

## Status Snapshot

- **Current milestone:** `v0.2.30 — Upload retry added`
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-07
- **Track:** Home Assistant Integration + Home Assistant Add-on (Ingress Web UI)
- **Latest shipped improvements:** github_sync_app layout + root README preserved + snapshot structure documented + startup path fixed + 504 upload retry
- **Current operator UX:** Device Login section first, existing/create repo flow, troubleshooting auth overrides hidden by default
- **Version state:** See auto-managed tracker below.

<!-- VERSION:START -->
- Integration version: `0.2.30`
- Add-on version: `0.2.30`
- Channel: `stable`
- Release tag: `v0.2.30`
<!-- VERSION:END -->

## Cross-device handoff (use this first on another machine)

1. Open this file (`PROJECT_PLAN.md`) and read **Status Snapshot** + **Active Sprint Tracker**.
2. Verify the latest tag/release in GitHub and keep this tracker aligned with the shipped version.
3. Update this file after each shipped change so the tracker stays in sync.
4. Ship via: version bump → tag → GitHub release.

**Current repo context**

- Integration path: `custom_components/github_config_sync/`
- Add-on path: `addons/github-config-sync/`
- Add-on web app: `addons/github-config-sync/rootfs/app/`
- Version sync script: `scripts/sync_versions.py`

## Work completed so far (history + outcomes)

### Integration and platform foundations

- [x] Fixed integration load errors caused by stale constants/imports.
- [x] Completed integration/repo rename and branding alignment to **Github Config Sync**.
- [x] Stabilized config flow behavior and handler compatibility.
- [x] Implemented GitHub OAuth Device Flow for the integration setup path.
- [x] Added HACS + Hassfest validation workflow and metadata scaffolding.

### Add-on architecture and runtime

- [x] Built Home Assistant add-on scaffold (`addons/github-config-sync/`) with ingress UI.
- [x] Added API/runtime surfaces: options, status, health, sync trigger.
- [x] Introduced structured sync core (`sync/engine`, `sync/github_client`, `sync/models`, `sync/errors`).
- [x] Added hash-index based file diffing (added/changed/removed) and runtime summaries.
- [x] Added sync test coverage for hashing, planning, and API behavior.

### Major production fixes shipped

- [x] Fixed add-on image/base compatibility and build failures.
- [x] Resolved PEP 668 packaging issue by installing Flask via Alpine package (`py3-flask`) instead of system pip.
- [x] Added add-on `CHANGELOG.md` so Supervisor can resolve changelog metadata.
- [x] Fixed UI non-JSON parsing failure handling.
- [x] Fixed ingress API 404 behavior by using ingress-aware API paths in frontend.

### UX work discussed and implemented

- [x] Moved Device Flow controls to a dedicated top section.
- [x] Hid token/client ID inputs behind troubleshooting controls by default.
- [x] Added repository mode UX: choose **existing repo** (picker) or **create new repo**.
- [x] Added backend repo endpoints for list/create and UI wiring to persist selected repo.

### Release and process

- [x] Published iterative stable releases through `v0.0.23` (add-on `0.1.6`).
- [x] Added/used automated version sync script across integration/add-on/docs.
- [x] Added this in-repo tracker as the canonical cross-device status document.

---

## What we agreed in discussion (product decisions)

- Device Flow is the default auth path for both integration and add-on UX.
- Token/client ID should not be front-and-center for normal users.
- Repository selection should be guided (picker/create) instead of manual-only typing.
- Keep both Hassfest and HACS validation in place while integration distribution continues.
