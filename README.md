## Home Assistant Add-on (Web UI)

This repository now also includes a containerized Home Assistant add-on with ingress UI under:

`addons/github-config-sync/`

Add-on repository metadata is provided via `repository.yaml` so it can be added directly in Home Assistant Add-on Store.

## Architecture

- The custom integration handles Home Assistant entities, config flow, and operator actions.
- The add-on provides the ingress web UI and the sync runtime API.
- Sync planning is hash-based: the add-on scans `/config`, diffs against the last saved hash index, and classifies files as added, changed, or removed.
- Dry runs do not touch GitHub; live runs probe the repository first, then upsert and delete files through the GitHub Contents API.
- State, logs, device-flow data, and the last hash index live in `/data`.
- The add-on exposes a stable local API contract via `/api/health`, `/api/status`, `/api/sync`, and `/api/diagnostics`.
- The generated `.gitignore` includes the common Home Assistant guidance entries such as `secrets.yaml`, `ip_bans.yaml`, `known_devices.yaml`, `.storage/`, and `.cloud/`, while still honoring any local user additions.
- After a release, Home Assistant may need a rebuild/reinstall to pick up UI changes from the add-on image.

## Runbook

### Dry run

1. Open the add-on UI and confirm `github_repository`, `github_branch`, and `dry_run=true`.
2. Start or complete GitHub device login if a token is not already present.
3. Run a sync and review the scan summary and dry-run result in the status panel.
4. Confirm the result shows the expected upsert/delete counts without changing GitHub contents.

### Live run

1. Verify the target repository exists and is accessible with the saved token.
2. Confirm the branch name is correct for the target repo.
3. Set `dry_run=false` in the add-on settings.
4. Run a sync, or use **Clean Upload** to force a full re-upload plus cleanup of remote extras.
5. Confirm the repository probe succeeds before the write phase.
6. Review the status panel and logs for the final upsert/delete/skip counts.

### Diagnostics bundle

1. Open the add-on UI.
2. Click **Download Diagnostics**.
3. Share the resulting JSON with support or use it to compare config, status, and sanitized logs.

## Release checklist

Before tagging a release:

1. Bump the integration/add-on versions as needed.
2. Run the repository validation workflow and the add-on test suite.
3. Confirm the docs and plan are updated.
4. Create the tag and publish the release.
5. Update the changelog and migration notes.

## Installation (Add-on)

1. In Home Assistant, open **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → Repositories**.
2. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/MJP-76/GithubConfigSync`.
3. Install **Github Config Sync** add-on and start it.
4. Open the add-on web UI (ingress), configure repository settings, and complete GitHub Device Flow login.

## Installation (HACS)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Add `MJP-76/GithubConfigSync` as a custom repository (category: Integration).
3. Install **Github Config Sync** and restart Home Assistant.

## Features

- GitHub OAuth Device Flow login (approve on github.com)
- Create a new repository or use an existing one
- Sync the Home Assistant config folder into GitHub
- Auto-generate a Home Assistant-friendly `.gitignore`
- Let you add extra ignore patterns from setup
- Manual sync button in Home Assistant
- Scheduled syncs every 24 hours by default
- Customizable sync start time and repeat interval
- Ignore patterns for files you do not want uploaded

## Notes

- This is not a zip-backup integration.
- Files are synced individually as repository contents.
- The Home Assistant config folder is used automatically.
- A managed `.gitignore` is created with Home Assistant defaults and your extra patterns.
- Keep the repository private if the config contains sensitive data.
- The uploaded base was adapted into this folder-sync implementation.
- If `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` is set in `custom_components/github_config_sync/const.py`, the flow uses it and skips asking for client ID.

## Sync verification

- **Dry run**: use `dry_run: true` first to confirm the scan is picking up added, changed, and removed files without pushing anything.
- **Live run**: switch `dry_run` to `false` only after the dry-run summary looks correct, then confirm the repository probe succeeds and the run reports upserts/deletes as expected.
- **Recovery check**: if a file is missing locally during a live run, it is counted as skipped rather than forcing a bad write.
